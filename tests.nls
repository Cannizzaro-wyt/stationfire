to test-crowd-at-exit ; tests the number of people between a person and the exit they're aiming for
  ask one-of people [show crowd-at-exit] ; should always be a whole positive number

to test-see ; tests both the see command and the vision parameter

end

to test-speed ; tests set-speed, slow-down, speed-up
  ask one-of people [ show speed face next-patch set-speed show speed] ; should display two different positive numbers: them being different indicates that the person is responding to their environment
end ; exception is if person is alone in their environment, in which case if both numbers are equal to the speed limit that is also an acceptable outcome

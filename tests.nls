  ask people [show fh]
  ; h is the typical abbreviation for 'heuristic' but this is based on Jieshi Fang's work, thus 'j'

to test-a-star
  ask people [show A-star (patch-here) (fh) (preferredexit) (patch-here)] ; second patch-here is supposed to be successors
  ; figuring out how to get the tables back to lists and sorted in order to actually use successors was low-priority

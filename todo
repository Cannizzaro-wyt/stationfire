Issues to solve:
	Improved smoke model (Roni)
	Visibility and making it dependent on smoke
	Translating leader-follower model into NetLogo
	Exit preference
	Windows become exits as a matter of urgency + proximity + time
	Jieshi’s equations influence direction but not the primary determinant of direction (patch in-radius?) (Eileen)
	Set speed to decrease with damage.
	Reporters
		Xy at beginning vs end
		time to exit or death
		group size
		group composition
		Did group members survive?
